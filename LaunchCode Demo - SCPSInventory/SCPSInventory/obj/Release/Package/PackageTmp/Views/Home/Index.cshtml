<h2>Introduction to Project</h2>

<p>
    Florida's state regulations require public school boards to inventory all of the capitalized assets they hold annually. Seminole County Public Scools is a large school 
    system in Florda that contains over 60 schools and many other educational support facilities. Combined, these facilities possess over 20,000 capitalized assets. It is
    the objective of the Seminole County Public Schools' property records department to inventory each and every one of these assets once a year. 
</p>
<p>
    In order to accomplish this task, a system has been implemented in which each capitalized asset is assigned a unique asset identification number (asset id) and
    input into an inventory management database. This database also maintains a record of which assets belong to which school or department (cost center). Each cost center
    is then responsible for keeping track of its assets throughout the year and presenting them to a third party contractor who conducts the official annual inventory
    over the course of 2-3 days.
</p>
<p>  
    Currently there is no unifying system that has been put in place by property records to help cost centers keep track of their assets throughout the year. They have access 
    to the database which lists the assets they are responsible for, but that is about it. As you can imagine the success and efficiency of inventories vary quite a bit cost 
    center to cost center depending upon the individuals who have been designated to control a cost centers inventory.
</p>
<p>
    This web application has been designed as a tool to help the cost centers to be able to better keep track of their inventory throughout the year. It accomplishes this
    by allowing cost centers to view their assets along with location information for each asset. In addition, it allows the cost centers to conduct their own unofficial 
    inventories which update location information for each asset.
